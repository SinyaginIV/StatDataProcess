My first independent project as a programmer for the final coursework at the end of the 2nd year of university. C# program using Windows Forms. This program allows:
1. Perform statistical processing of a series by finding the primary methods of statistical processing of data such as sample mean (arithmetic mean), variance, mode and median, and construct a data distribution table to better represent the data. To do this, you need to enter the variants and the multiplicity of these variants in the table.
2. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient by entering X and Y values. The program will calculate the coefficient and construct a scatter plot (correlation graph).
The program provides examples with already entered data.
